# 14 SHAP for Actuaries: Explain any Model

This sub-repository contains both Python and R notebooks with models and analyses similar to (but not 100% equal to) the results published in the tutorial on SHAP.

Both files will need the the following dataset:

## Data set

The folder "rdata" contains the dataset "df.parquet", representing 1 mio rows of synthetic (but realistic) claims frequency data, see above code for how to import it into Python and R.
